# Jess Inventory Example
#
# This file demonstrates the structure and options for the jess inventory file.
# By default, jess looks for this file at ~/.jess/inventory.yaml
#
# You can edit this file directly with: jess edit
# You can load a different inventory file with: jess load /path/to/inventory.yaml
# You can view your current inventory with: jess show

devices:
  # Basic router example with all connection methods
  - hostname: router1                      # Hostname used for lookup with 'jess router1'
    ip: 192.168.1.1                        # IP address or domain name
    protocols:                             # Connection methods in order of preference
      - ssh-modern                         # Try modern SSH first (most secure)
      - ssh-legacy                         # Fall back to legacy SSH if modern fails
      - telnet                             # Last resort: try Telnet (least secure)
    username: admin                        # Username for authentication
    password: securepass                   # Password for authentication

  # Modern switch example with only SSH
  - hostname: switch1
    ip: 192.168.1.2
    protocols:
      - ssh-modern                         # Only try modern SSH
    username: admin
    password: switch_password

  # Legacy device example that needs relaxed SSH settings
  - hostname: legacy-device
    ip: 10.0.0.5
    protocols:
      - ssh-legacy                         # Start with legacy SSH for old devices
      - telnet                             # Fall back to Telnet if needed
    username: admin
    password: legacy_pass

  # Telnet-only device example
  - hostname: telnet-only
    ip: 10.0.0.10
    protocols:
      - telnet                             # Only try Telnet
    username: admin
    password: telnet_pass

  # Example with domain name instead of IP
  - hostname: cloud-router
    ip: router.example.com                 # Domain name works too
    protocols:
      - ssh-modern
    username: cloud_admin
    password: cloud_pass

# Protocol Options Explained:
# 
# ssh-modern: Uses modern SSH algorithms and security settings
#   - Best for newer devices and security-conscious environments
#   - Uses strict host key checking
#   - Supports modern encryption algorithms
#
# ssh-legacy: Uses relaxed SSH settings for compatibility
#   - For older network devices with basic SSH implementations
#   - Disables strict host key checking
#   - Enables legacy key exchange algorithms and ciphers
#   - Less secure but more compatible
#
# telnet: Uses the Telnet protocol
#   - For very old devices or those without SSH support
#   - Unencrypted - passwords sent in plaintext
#   - Use only when necessary for compatibility
