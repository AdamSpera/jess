# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python-based terminal connection management tool called "jess" that can be installed via pip and used from anywhere on the system. The tool manages network device connections through SSH and Telnet protocols, using a YAML configuration file to store device information and connection preferences. The tool provides intelligent connection fallback mechanisms and colored console output for user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to install the jess tool via pip so that I can use it from anywhere on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `pip3 install git@...` THEN the system SHALL install the jess package successfully
2. WHEN the installation is complete THEN the user SHALL be able to run `jess` command from any directory
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies for SSH, Telnet, and YAML processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to connect to devices by hostname so that I can quickly access my network equipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `jess <hostname>` THEN the system SHALL look up the hostname in the YAML inventory file
2. WHEN a hostname is found THEN the system SHALL attempt connection using the configured protocols and credentials
3. WHEN a hostname is not found THEN the system SHALL display an error message with colored output
4. WHEN a connection is successful THEN the system SHALL transfer the user into the active SSH/Telnet session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the tool to try multiple connection methods automatically so that I can connect to both modern and legacy network hardware without manual troubleshooting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a device THEN the system SHALL first attempt SSH with modern key algorithms and security settings
2. WHEN modern SSH fails THEN the system SHALL attempt SSH with legacy key algorithms and relaxed security settings to support very old network hardware
3. WHEN both SSH methods fail THEN the system SHALL attempt Telnet connection for devices that only support basic protocols
4. WHEN all connection methods fail THEN the system SHALL display a failure message and exit
5. WHEN SSH requires credentials THEN the system SHALL automatically provide the configured username and password
6. WHEN using legacy SSH THEN the system SHALL enable compatibility with extremely basic SSH implementations found on old network equipment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to manage my device inventory through simple commands so that I can easily update connection information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `jess edit` THEN the system SHALL open the inventory YAML file in nano editor
2. WHEN the user runs `jess load <filename>` THEN the system SHALL replace the current inventory with the specified local file
3. WHEN loading a file THEN the system SHALL validate the YAML format before replacing the inventory
4. WHEN the inventory file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create a default template file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want clear visual feedback about connection attempts so that I can understand what the tool is doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting any connection method THEN the system SHALL display colored status messages indicating the current action
2. WHEN a connection attempt fails THEN the system SHALL display a colored failure message with the reason
3. WHEN a connection succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a colored success message
4. WHEN trying fallback methods THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which method is being attempted
5. WHEN displaying status messages THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors (green for success, red for failure, yellow for attempts)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to store device information in a structured format so that I can easily manage multiple devices with different connection requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a device THEN the YAML file SHALL contain hostname, IP address, connection protocols array, username, and password fields
2. WHEN specifying connection protocols THEN the system SHALL support "ssh-modern", "ssh-legacy", and "telnet" options
3. WHEN the YAML file is malformed THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with colored output
4. WHEN accessing device information THEN the system SHALL parse the YAML file and extract the relevant connection details
5. WHEN no inventory file exists THEN the system SHALL create a sample configuration file with example entries
